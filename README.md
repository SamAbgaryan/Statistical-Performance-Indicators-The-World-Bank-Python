Statistical Performance Indicators-Python: I used Python to wrangle and analyze a dataset provided by the World Bank.

Objective: To understand which regions have the lowest SPI scores in order to develop a plan foused on helping countries fallen behind.

Key Questions: Did COVID-19 pandemic act as a catalyst improving scores across the globe? Which countires have the higest SPI scores? Which countires have the lowest scores? Which regions have the lowest scores? What are potential ways of helping those with low scores improve performance?

Datasets: the dataset is not included due to size, however, it can be accessed by following the [link](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037996/Statistical-Performance-Indicators)

Folders: The project files are divided between the following folders: ●Project Brief ● 6.1 Sourcing Open Data ● 6.2 Exploring Relationships ● 6.3 Geographical Visualizations with Python ● 6.4 Supervised Machine Learning-Regression ● 6.5 Unsupervised Machine Learning-Clustering ● 6.6 Soucing and Time Series Analysis

Visualizations: All visualizations were created in Tableau Public and may be viewed by following this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sam.abgaryan/viz/WorldBankSPIScores/WorldBankSPIScores?publish=yes)
